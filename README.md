Refeed
======

Re-create an RSS feed based on SEO/Social meta.

RSS feeds for many sites exist, but little effort is made to design them. SEO/
and social media metadata are often added, and lots of effort is made there.

This takes an existing RSS feed and re-creates it using social media metadata.
